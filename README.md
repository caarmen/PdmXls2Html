# PdmXls2Html

This is just a backup of a tool I'm using to generate static html pages for a specific website.

It's definitely not a generic tool that can be applied to any website.

But perhaps some parts of it might be useful as examples of how to read Excel files or use FreeMarker to generate HTML pages.

This project uses two librairies:
